    <h1> Cosmic Chaos </h1>

    <p>Sam had never seen such a bright, large moon. It was like a great eye, peering down from the sky, illuminating the landscape in shining silver. The snow was untouched before the house, and the world was perfectly dark and silent. It had been a long day, despite being the shortest day of the year.</p>
    <div class="picture" id="pic1">
    </div>
    <p>
        The moon illuminated the fresh snow and the reflection was rather bright. Oddly enough, you remebered you had walked from the house, yet when you looked back your footprints weren't there. Surely you were just imagining things; you did have a long day afterall.
    </p>
    <div class="picture" id="pic2">
    </div>
    <p>
        I think to myself and wonder if you're seeing things again. Another one of your episodes, I'm sure. I suppose I had been irrational and a dreamer thinking that you would recover fully from the last time you were in the hospital, I just wanted things to get better. Who even knows if you'll make it until Christmas-- it's time to be realistic.
    </p>
    <div class="picture" id="pic3"></div>
    <p>
        But as the night drew on, I realized you weren't seeing things. This wasn't another one of your episodes, because I was seeing things too. The colors were vivid and alive, moving across the sky. Maybe this is real, maybe it isn't, maybe we are both crazy and seeing things together, but for now, I don't care.
    </p>
    <div class="picture" id="pic4"></div>
    <p>
        Being crazy with you is better than being sane with anyone else. Episode or not, we are electric together. The lights and colors in every direction scream our names and all I can think is, "this is right". I wish this night would never end because in this moment, we are frozen in time and nothing else matters.
    </p>
    <div class="picture" id="pic5"></div>
    <p>
        But eventually, the sun's rays started to peak out from the horizon and everything changed. A new day, a new you, a new us. It was confusing, not knowing if the beautiful colors of last night were real or not. Every memory I have with you is tainted by the idea that it could've been an episode. I wiped the sleep from my eyes and started rolling out of bed when suddenly I felt it coming -- a familiar electric pain from behind my temples.
    </p>
    <div class="picture" id="pic6"></div>
    <p>
        It built as I pulled myself out of the warmth of my comforter, slowing moving from an annoying buzz to a blinding static pain. My head throbbed so badly that my eyes began to blur over, and my knees buckled. I became convinced that the beauty and wonder of last night must have merely been a dream. Surely this pain was reality, and such perfection seemed incompatible with the agony I was currently in.
    </p>
    <div class="picture" id="pic7"></div>
    <p>
        I tried to get out of bed, tried to lift my head off of my pillow and take my mind off of anything other than the pain consuming my thoughts and body. From the incredible evening last night, I simply couldn't believe that things could change so drastically. I reach for the phone to call you and see if you feel the same way.
    </p>
    <div class="picture" id="pic8"></div>
    <p>
        That's odd, you didn't pick up. Sure we were tired, but you said you would reach out to me before you go to bed. I probably am over thinking this, you obviosuly just passed out and need your rest. I mean, we didn't take THAT much... right?
    </p>
    <div class="picture" id="pic9"></div>
    <p>
        I peered out the window, surprised to see the colors again. It was brief, only for a second, ribboning across the sky as if to remind me that last night was not in my imagination. I waited for it to happen again, but there was nothing. As the morning turned to day, I began to notice things weren't the same as normal. I'm sure you'd be calling me back any second to say you were also feeling strange. What exactly did we take last night?
    </p>
    <div class="picture" id="pic10"></div>
    <p>
        The phone finally rang. I picked up and my heart quieted at the sound of your voice. That didn't last long though because your hysteria spread to me as quickly as the colors appeared and disappeared last night. You said you were feeling strange too and spewed out words faster than my dizzy head could take them in. You were talking about colors, the sky, the moon... now the stars... something about -- wait. What was that? The call abruptly ended and I knew I had to get to you. Fast.
    </p>
    <div class="picture" id="pic11"></div>
    <p>
        I knew that, to elicit that much panic in your normally calm voice, something drastic must have happened. I knew that those colors were too good to be trueâ€”every wonderful gift comes with a price, and we were about to start paying. I sprinted out the door and stared at the sky. The colors had returned, swirling, twisting, torquing through the air, and at the core was deep black patch, consuming every drop of light that neared it.
    </p>
    <div class="picture" id="pic12"></div>
    <p>
        Panic set in. Were my eyes deceiving me? Surely not; those wild and abstract colors seemed clear as day and were brightly illuminating the sky. I felt the wind start to pick up as these chaotic events continued to get more intense. I booked it into the living room, turned on the tv, and not a peep of "Breaking News" was reporting the anomaly outside. I had to find someone... something wasn't right. I had to find someone.
    </p>
    <div class="picture" id="pic13"></div>
    <p>
        I ran out the front door. The strong winds nearly took the door off it's hinges, but I didn't care. I had to find someone who could help me, there had to be someone. The streets were empty. Where was the postman who usually made his rounds around this time? Or my lazy bum of a neighbor who was always sitting and watching the neighborhood from his front porch? I shielded my eyes from the brilliant colors in the sky and the fierce winds that were whipping in every direction.
    </p>
    <div class="picture" id="pic14"></div>
    <p>
        There was no way this was real, I knew it wasn't real. But how could I possibly believe that as I watch what is occurring before my eyes. I made my way to your house, hoping you were also on your way to me. There were no people outside and I couldn't help the feeling that all of this, the colors streaming through the sky and wind howling, was all about you and me. We were supposed to be together again. As I neared your house, I saw you on the front porch. We ran towards each other and as soon as you grabbed my arm, the colors stopped. The air was suddenly still. We looked into each others eyes and suddenly I saw the colors again. Not in the sky, but in your eyes. Was any of this real? I couldn't be sure, but nothing has ever felt as real as this moment, so I don't care.
    </p>
