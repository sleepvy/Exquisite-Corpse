  <p>Sam had never seen such a bright, large moon. It was like a great eye, peering down from the sky, illuminating the landscape in shining silver. The snow was untouched before the house, and the world was perfectly dark and silent. It had been a long day, despite being the shortest day of the year.</p>
  
  <p>
        The moon illuminated the fresh snow and the reflection was rather bright. Oddly enough, you remebered you had walked from the house, yet when you looked back your footprints weren't there. Surely you were just imagining things; you did have a long day afterall. 
  </p>
  <p>
        I think to myself and wonder if you're seeing things again.  Another one of your episodes, I'm sure.  I suppose I had been irrational and a dreamer thinking that you would recover fully from the last time you were in the hospital, I just wanted things to get better. Who even knows if you'll make it until Christmas-- it's time to be realistic.
